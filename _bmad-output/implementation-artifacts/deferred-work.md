# Deferred Work

Items surfaced incidentally during review, deferred for later focused attention.

- source_spec: `spec-1-2-design-system-tokens-fonts-buttons.md`
  summary: `src/app/(site)/layout.tsx` sets `<html lang="ru">` but the site content is English (all prototypes EN, US B2B, Epic 2 form English) — should be `lang="en"`.
  evidence: Pre-existing from Story 1.1 scaffold; surfaced by review's Cyrillic-subset findings. Latin-only font subsets are correct for English content; the `lang` attribute is a separate a11y/SEO correctness bug, out of scope for the DS-tokens story.

- source_spec: `spec-1-3-header-desktop-mobile.md`
  summary: No "skip to content" bypass link before the persistent site nav — keyboard users must tab through all 6 nav links on every one of the 6 routes (WCAG 2.4.1 Bypass Blocks, level A).
  evidence: Real, but cross-cutting: a proper skip link needs a stable `<main id>` landmark target and a shell-level decision on page/main structure (the layout renders `{children}` directly, pages own their own markup). Not local to the header diff — belongs to a focused shell/a11y pass, not a header follow-up patch.

- source_spec: `spec-1-3-header-desktop-mobile.md`
  summary: No `prefers-reduced-motion` handling for the header's scroll-reactive motion (height shrink + `translateY(-100%)` hide slide + box-shadow); WCAG 2.3.3 vestibular concern.
  evidence: Real, but better solved DS-wide than header-only: Story 1.5 adds reveal-on-scroll (more motion needing the same treatment) and theme.css already tokenizes motion. A header-scoped patch would be a fragmented half-measure; warrants one DS-level `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` policy pass. Prototype has none, so this is a deliberate a11y enhancement beyond faithful reproduction.

- source_spec: `spec-1-4-footer-desktop-columns-mobile-accordions.md`
  summary: Mobile footer accordion open-state uses a verbatim fixed `max-height:420px` (shell.css `.site-footer--mb .facc.open .facc-body`); content taller than 420px (browser text-zoom, translated/i18n strings, or editable `SiteSettings` data in Epic 7) is silently clipped and its links become unreachable.
  evidence: Faithful to the prototype now (AD-13; `mobile.css:135`) and under the ceiling for current static content (~200px), so not a defect in this story. Becomes real when footer content is no longer fixed — most likely at the Epic 7 `SiteSettings` seam or under i18n. The robust replacement is animating `grid-template-rows:0fr↔1fr` (or measuring `scrollHeight`) instead of a fixed clamp; deferred because changing it now would deviate from the pixel source of truth with no present benefit.

- source_spec: `spec-1-5-mobile-chassis-drawer-scroll-lock-reveal.md`
  summary: The mobile nav drawer has no modal focus management — opening it does not move focus into the drawer, closing does not restore focus to the burger, Tab is not trapped inside the open drawer, and it lacks `role="dialog"`/`aria-modal`. Keyboard/SR users can tab out of the open drawer into the scrim-covered background.
  evidence: Real a11y gap, but beyond the prototype (plain `mobile.js` has zero focus handling) and beyond this story's spec. `inert`/`aria-hidden` on the closed drawer and Escape-to-close are already implemented; a full focus-trap + dialog semantics + focus restore is a deliberate enhancement that deserves focused implementation and testing (initial-focus target, trap edges, restore on all four close paths) rather than an unattended patch. Applies equally to any future modal overlay, so warrants one shared a11y-modal approach.

- source_spec: `spec-1-6-pixel-acceptance-breakpoint-checklist-preview.md`
  summary: Catalog's `981` breakpoint is a hover-gated query (`@media (hover:hover) and (min-width:981px)`), paired with `@media (hover:none)` and `prefers-reduced-motion:reduce` branches; the pixel checklist covers width-bands (validated with a mouse/hover pointer) but has no acceptance rows for the touch-at-desktop-width (hover:none) layout or the reduced-motion catalog rendering.
  evidence: Real latent coverage gap surfaced by the edge-case review, but non-blocking here: this story only fixes the pixel-band acceptance contract, and the Catalog page itself does not exist yet (built in Epic 5). Hover/pointer-capability and reduced-motion acceptance belong with the Catalog implementation story, where the interaction branches actually ship and can be verified. Width-band math for /catalog is correct as written.

- source_spec: `spec-2-1-contactform-component-validation.md`
  summary: ContactForm uses hardcoded global DOM ids (`contactForm`, `cf-name`, `cf-email`, …) baked into the content module; two simultaneous mounts (Story 2.4 renders the same form as a desktop modal AND in page flow / mobile-nav) will produce duplicate `id`s, breaking `htmlFor` label→input and `aria-describedby` error associations (clicking a label focuses the first matching instance).
  evidence: Real, but latent — Story 2.1 mounts exactly one instance (inline on `/contact`), where the ids are valid and correctly match the pixel prototype's `cf-*` ids. The collision only manifests when Story 2.4 introduces the second concurrent mount. The fix (scope ids with React `useId`) is a small change but belongs with 2.4's multi-mount work, where it can be verified against all three display modes; doing it now would fork the id contract from the prototype with no present consumer.

- source_spec: `spec-2-1-contactform-component-validation.md`
  summary: The client-validation error UX has a11y gaps beyond the prototype — only the focused (first-invalid) field's message is announced via `aria-describedby`; the other N−1 error messages appear silently (no `role="alert"`/live region); required fields carry no `aria-required` or visual required marker; and the in-page mount's outline jumps to `<h3>` with no `<h1>`.
  evidence: Real, but consistent with this project's established pattern of deferring a11y-beyond-prototype to a focused pass (see the header reduced-motion, drawer focus-trap, and skip-link deferrals). The prototype has no validation and no required markers, so these are net-new a11y surface. `role="alert"`/`aria-required` are invisible and cheap but warrant deliberate testing (multi-error announcement order, SR verification) rather than an unattended patch; the `<h1>` outline belongs to the real `/contact` page structure built in Story 2.4, not this bare verification mount.

- source_spec: `spec-2-2-crm-submit-server-action-states.md`
  summary: ContactForm submit SUCCESS is not announced to assistive tech — the error path got `role="alert"`, but success only swaps the submit button's text to `THANK YOU ✓` (a label change inside a button is not reliably announced by screen readers) and focus is never moved, so AT users may not perceive the send succeeded before the 1600ms reset wipes the form.
  evidence: Real, and matches the project's a11y-beyond-prototype deferral pattern (see the 2.1 error-announcement, header reduced-motion, drawer focus-trap deferrals). The prototype (Contact.html) also only swaps the button text — no success live-region — so a `role="status"` success announcement is net-new a11y surface. It is cheap but warrants deliberate SR verification (announcement timing vs the 1600ms reset, whether to move focus) rather than an unattended patch, and pairs naturally with the deferred 2.1 error-UX a11y pass. The core AC (visible confirmation + reset) is met faithfully.

- source_spec: `spec-2-3-anti-spam-protection.md`
  summary: The security-relevant `submitContactForm` logic — the honeypot silent-drop (`{ ok: true }` with no CRM POST) and the 6-field CRM-body stripping (`const { honeypot: _honeypot, ...lead }`) — has no automated test coverage, so a future refactor that reorders the honeypot check after the POST, or drops the key-strip, would ship silently.
  evidence: Real, but pre-existing and project-wide: the project ships no test runner by explicit design (spec Never-boundary — verification is build/lint/manual, same as stories 2.1/2.2), so this is not a defect of this story. `submitContactForm` already takes an injectable `action` and `validateContactForm` is pure, so the drop-path and 6-field-body invariants are trivially unit-testable once a runner is adopted. Adding a runner is forbidden here; belongs to a focused testing-adoption pass, where the honeypot silent-drop and CRM-body contract are prime regression targets.
