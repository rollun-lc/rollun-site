/**
 * Stats count-up (Story 3.4) — a single leaf island (AD-1) that ENHANCES the
 * static SSR frame Story 3.1 rendered in `Stats.tsx`, never rewriting the DOM
 * (same precedent as `RevealOnScroll` / `HeroMosaic` / `ProductLineSwitcher`). It
 * renders NOTHING (`return null`): all work happens in `useEffect`, so there is
 * no hydration mismatch and the SSR frame (each `.stat-value` already showing its
 * FINAL value — `2015`, `12`, `80,000`, `30%`) stands as the pre-hydration /
 * no-JS / reduced-motion fallback.
 *
 * The `fmt` / `animate` count-up and the IntersectionObserver (threshold 0.4,
 * once-only via `data-done`) are ported VERBATIM from `Home.html` (~lines
 * 1349-1381): `dur=1800`, cubic ease-out `1 - (1 - p)^3`, `fmt(final*eased) +
 * suffix`, driven by `requestAnimationFrame`. `data-final` / `data-suffix` /
 * `data-format` are read straight off the SSR markup — the island never guesses.
 *
 * When motion is allowed the island resets every `.stats .stat-value` to `0` on
 * mount (like `HeroMosaic` mutes its tiles), then counts each element up to its
 * target when it scrolls into view (AC: "before the trigger the final value is
 * not shown"). The Stats section sits below the fold, so the brief SSR-final → `0`
 * swap is never seen. Both compositions (`.home-dk` / `.home-mb`) share one DOM;
 * the hidden one (`offsetParent === null`) is skipped and simply stays at `0`
 * until a 768px resize lays it out, at which point the resize handler counts it up.
 *
 * The trigger is DELIBERATELY belt-and-braces: an `IntersectionObserver` is the
 * primary path, but it can miss (iOS Safari quirks; the section already in view at
 * mount after an SPA nav), which used to leave the counters frozen at `0`. So a
 * geometry check also runs on mount and on every passive scroll/resize; whichever
 * fires first wins and a `data-done` flag keeps each count-up single-shot. The
 * numbers can therefore never get stuck at `0` while motion is allowed.
 *
 * Policy: the count-up ALWAYS runs — `prefers-reduced-motion` is intentionally NOT
 * honoured (the site's motion is always on). The SSR final frame is still the no-JS
 * fallback: with JS off, the numbers render at their final values.
 *
 * The effect is keyed on `usePathname()` (like the sibling islands) and its
 * cleanup disconnects the observer — so SPA navigation leaves nothing running.
