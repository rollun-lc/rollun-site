// Story 6.2 — Our Shops (`/shops`). A pure function of `shopsContent`: the page
// holds no strings of its own, it only wires the single content instance into
// the section RSCs in EXACT Handoff order and imports the section stylesheet.
// Header, Footer and RevealOnScroll are rendered by the layout (Epic 1) — NOT
// here.
//
// Both compositions (desktop + mobile) SSR into one DOM inside each section; the
// visible one is chosen ONLY by the 768px CSS media in shops.css. Handoff order
// (identical on both prototypes):
//   Hero (01) → Store (02) → Marketplaces (03)
